<P class="sz10">The term <b class="sz10r">"heart problems"</b> may range from skipped beats through benign congestive heart failure to angina and heart attack (Myocardial Infarction). <i><b>Ask about symptoms which more
accurately indicate the urgency of the problem (i.e. PRIORITY SYMPTOMS):</i></b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Consciousness
<li>Breathing
<li>Chest pain
<li>Altered mental status
</ul>
Automatic Implanted Defibrillator (AID): Implanted under the skin similar to a pacemaker. The unit detects specific life threatening arrhythmia and automatically shocks the patient.<br>
<br><b class="sz10r">Pediatric considerations:</b> Heart problems in this age group usually involve congenital defects. Parents are frequently aware of this because of problems the child has already faced. These conditions often cause the child to go into heart failure with acute symptoms of difficulty of breathing, change in color and altered mental status.</P>
