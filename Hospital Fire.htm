<ul class="sz10">
<li>Potential evacuation – consider where to send victims. Local disaster plans may have to be activated to arrange sheltering of non-ambulatory patients.
<li>Consider the potential threat from medical gases, electrical problems and biohazards.
<li>If confirmed fire, ensure local EMS agency is prepared for evacuation / transfer of patients.
<li>Advise supervisor so a separate phone number can be published for media inquiries, <b>NOT IN THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.</b>
