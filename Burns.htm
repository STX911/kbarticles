<P CLASS="sz14b"><B>Burns<br>Useful Information</B></P>
<b class="sz10r">Types:</b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li>First degree (Reddened skin)
<li>Second degree (Blistering skin)
<li>Third degree (Charring/pale white; damage to all skin layers)
<li>Fourth degree (Involves underlying fat, muscle, and bone)
</ul>
<b class="sz10r">Special Problems:</b>
<P class="sz10"><u>Airway Problems:</u> Often associated with facial burns. May be due to thermal injury, as well as reaction to inhaled smoke or fumes and particles of combustion. 30% of victims with major burns have airway problems and all burn patients are at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.<br><br>
<u>Electrical Burns:</u> Wounds may appear minor, but underlying tissue damage may be extensive. There may be several wounds representing both the entrance and exit of the electrical current.<br><br>
<u>Extensive burns may cause shock.</u><br>
<br>
<b class="sz10r">Chemical Burns:</b><br>
<br>
Certain compounds and some industrial chemicals cause increased heat production and penetration when water is applied. HOWEVER, continuous, copious irrigation with a strong&nbsp stream of water will significantly reduce these effects and SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED while
looking for neutralizing agents. In general, THE EARLIER THE IRRIGATION, THE BETTER THE OUTCOME.<br>
<br>
<b class="sz10r">Pediatric considerations:</b><br>
Smaller airway places children at greater risk for airway compromise. Burns are the second most common cause of accidental death in children under 5 years of age.
