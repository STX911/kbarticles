Submerged vehicle incidents are among the most difficult to evaluate because of the aggravating, and ever-changing factors involved. Below are some of the key points a dispatcher should be aware of when dealing with a submerged vehicle incident.<br>
<br>Most passenger vehicles will float on the surface for a short period of time. All vehicles will sink, however. The rate at which the vehicle sinks can depend on many factors. The design, body style, construction quality, condition and age of the vehicle all impact the time it takes the vehicle to submerge. One thing is definite: if the water is deeper than the height of the vehicle body, it will disappear beneath the surface.<br> 
<br>A vehicle with the windows (and doors) open will submerge faster than the same vehicle with its windows (and doors) closed. The faster the water enters the interior of the vehicle, the faster it loses its buoyancy and the quicker it descends.<br> 
<br>A vehicle with the windows (and doors) closed creates a more serious situation. Water pressure pressing in against the vehicle body will prevent the doors from being opened until the vehicle submerges to the point where the pressure on the outside and inside is equalized.<br>
<br>A vehicle will generally sink nose first, due to the weight of the engine and the lack of trapped air in the front of the vehicle (assuming a front-mounted engine). While the initial descent may be slow, as the vehicle loses buoyancy its speed increases as it sinks. If the water is deep enough, the car will continue to "nose over," or flip over, during its dive to the bottom and may eventually come to rest upside down.<br>
<br>If the vehicle comes to rest upright on the bottom, there may be a small amount of air trapped against the interior of the roof. If the vehicle has sunk in deep water, it is likely that most of the air within the interior will escape through the rear seats and out of the trunk as it makes its plunge toward the bottom.<br>
<br>Power windows may work for a short while even as the vehicle starts to sink underwater. Once the window motors or switches get soaked, they will generally short out and the windows and electric door locks will no longer operate. However, the vehicle's battery may continue to put out electricity (possibly up to one hour), making it possible for headlights to be visible in as much as 20 feet of water.<br><br><a HREF="#return" class="link3">[Return]</a><br></p>
<a name="keyques" class="link3"></a><b class="sz10r">Key Questions</b><p>
As with all emergency calls, it's important to gather basic information as soon as possible. But keep in mind that if you're getting a call from a victim inside a submerged vehicle, there's a very good chance that caller will be hysterical.
Breaking a caller's hysteria threshold is crucial, since you may have to give the person complex instructions to get the victim(s) safely out of the car.
Asking the following key questions will enable you to capture the minimum information required to begin the dispatch process:
<ul class="sz10">
<li>What is the location of the incident? 
<li>Is victim inside the vehicle? 
<li>How many victims? Children or adults? 
<li>Is vehicle visible? Totally submerged? 
<li>Is there an access road to specific location? Landmarks? 
<li>If a third party is calling:
<li><i>Did you see the car go into the water?<br>If yes, how long since it entered the water?</i>
</ul>
<a HREF="#return" class="link3">[Return]</a>
 
<p class="sz10"><a name="paivictim" class="link3"></a><b class="sz10r">Pre-Arrival Instructions for Victims</b><BR>
If the caller is in a submerged vehicle, pre-arrival instructions are more critical than ever.<br><br>
Even if units respond in four to six minutes, locating and reaching the submerged vehicle may be extremely difficult. The best way to increase the chance of survival is to try to get the victim(s) out of the vehicle by providing the caller with specific instructions.
<br><br>If the vehicle is floating on the surface of the water:
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Instruct the victim(s) to release seatbelt(s). 
<li>Roll down the window(s) and unlock the door(s).
<li>Victim(s) should attempt to immediately exit vehicle through the window (If there are children, elderly or weak passengers in the vehicle push them out of the window). The attempt to exit via the windows should be made before the water level reaches the top of the door. The force of water rushing into the vehicle through open windows will make escape virtually impossible until the water flow slows and the interior is almost completely filled.<br> 
</ul>
<i>Note: Exiting through a passenger window may be easier than attempting an exit through the driver's side window. The steering column may make it difficult to get the leverage necessary to exit the vehicle.</i><br><br><a HREF="#return">[Return]</a><br></ul>
<b>If vehicle is submerging underwater OR the victim is unable to exit via the window</b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li>If windows are closed, instruct one of the victims to break the window with a foot or a sharp pointed object. 
<li>Instruct the victim to watch as the water enters the interior of the vehicle. 
<li>When the water approaches the level of the victim(s) heads, all passengers should take a deep breath and hold it. 
<li>The victim(s) should then attempt to forcefully open the door and exit the vehicle, swimming or floating to the surface.</ul>

<p class="sz10"><a name="pai3p"  class="link3"></a><b class="sz10r">Pre-Arrival Instructions for 3rd Parties Victims</b><br>
Dispatchers won't always get calls on these incidents from victims trapped in a vehicle. In fact, it's far more likely that the caller might be a witness to the situation. In these instances, dispatchers should keep the following pre-arrival instructions in mind to give to third party callers:
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Third parties <b>should not attempt</b> to go into the water.
<li>Mark the location on shore where the vehicle entered the water or was last seen afloat. 
<li>Continue to observe if anyone escapes and floats off in another direction away from the vehicle.  
<li>If the caller does see victim(s) afloat, ask the caller if he or she can extend a rope, pole, stick or other floatation device to the victim(s) without entering the water.  
<li>Instruct the caller not to take his or her eyes off the scene and to wait for the responders. 
<li>Ask if there is someone else with the caller who can go to the main road and flag down responding units.</ul>
