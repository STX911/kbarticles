<P CLASS="sz10r"><b>Non-Traumatic Types/Causes:</b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Tension
<li>Cluster
<li>Sinus
<li>Migraine
<li>Meningitis
<li><u>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</u> - Due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Frequently called "the worst headache I ever had". It is often preceded days before by a severe headache, which
resolved spontaneously and goes undiagnosed. (This is called a Sentinel Headache)
</ul>
<b class="sz10r">Traumatic Types/Causes:</b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li><u>Subdural Hematoma</u> - May develop slowly over weeks or months following an injury. Especially common in alcoholics and elderly.
</ul></P>
<P class="sz10">Alterations in mental status, speech and motor or sensory functions may reflect more serious conditions, with headache as the initial complaint.<br>
<br>
Sudden, severe onset may suggest a more serious underlying cause.<br>
<br>
The dispatcher should be alert to possible environmental hazards (carbon monoxide, natural gas, etc.).<br><br>
The vast majority of headaches are caused by structures surrounding the brain and the skull, and not the brain itself.<br><br>
A migraine is a "great pretender." It may be associated with temporary paralysis or loss of vision, mimicking other more serious conditions.<br><br>
Neck stiffness is common in subarachnoid hemorrhage and meningitis.<br>
<br>
<u>Post Concussive Syndrome</u> - Headache and dizziness may persist for weeks and even months following a simple concussion.<br>
