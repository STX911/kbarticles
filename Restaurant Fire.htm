<li>Is it possible there could be any mentally or physically handicapped occupants.
<li>Beware of potential for rapid spread through ducts.
<li>Many restaurant fires, especially after hours, occur in an attempt to collect on insurance. Since accurate descriptions of
  early stages of the fire may be crucial to an investigation, keep detailed records for investigators – all notations made during a call
  are admissible in court as evidence.
