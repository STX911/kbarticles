<P CLASS="sz10"><b class="sz10r">CVA = Cerebrovascular accident = Stroke = Brain dysfunction resulting from interrupted blood flow.</b>
<BR><BR>These patients most often present with slurred or incoherent speech,
altered mental status, paralysis, weakness or facial drooping.
<BR><BR><b class="sz10b">Most common causes:</b>
<ul class="sz10">
<li><b class="sz10r">Cerebral Thrombosis:</b> Clot forms inside a brain artery. 75-80% of
strokes. Major cause is "hardening of the arteries"
(Arteriosclerosis characterized by fat deposits in the arteries.)
<li><b class="sz10r">Cerebral Embolism:</b> Less common than thrombosis, but with more
rapid onset. Clot or fatty deposits form elsewhere in the body and
travel to the brain. Frequently from the heart chambers in
patients with certain cardiac arrythmias.
<li><b class="sz10r">Hemorrhage:</b> 15 -20% of strokes. Vessel in the brain bursts,
flooding the surrounding tissue. Sudden onset and rapid
progression. 80% fatal.
<li><b class="sz10r">IIA (Transient Ischemic Attack or "mini-stroke"):</b> Momentary
interruption in blood flow. Can be a precursor to an actual stroke.
</ul>
<P CLASS="sz10">Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours.
<BR><BR>
Symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected and the extent of
bleeding and/ or clot and may range from simple slurred speech to partial
paralysis to coma and death.
<BR><BR>
Except in cases of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure or ruptured
aneurysm, headache is NOT often a presenting complaint.
