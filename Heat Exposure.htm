<P CLASS="sz14b"><B>Heat Exposure<br>Useful Information</B></P>
<P CLASS="sz10">Heat illness is associated with high temperature and humidity but can occur in individuals working around furnaces, boilers, etc.<br>
<br>Cocaine, amphetamines and certain anti-depressants cause increased body heat contributing to heat intolerance.<br>
<br>Antihistamines, antispasmodics and high blood pressure medication also increase risk.<br>
<br>Very young and very old are most susceptible.<br>
<br>Military recruits, amateur athletes and chronically ill are at increased risk.<br>
<br><b class="sz10r">Heat Syncope (Fainting):</b> Common in non-acclimatized individuals during early stages of heat exposure.<br>
<br><b class="sz10r">Heat Cramps:</b> Muscle cramps, profuse sweating, nausea, muscle irritation.<br>
<br><b class="sz10r">Heat Exhaustion:</b> Pale, cool, clammy skin, gradual onset. Symptoms are non-specific and flu-like (dizziness, weakness, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting), but mental state remains normal.<br>
<br><i>The transition from <b>HEAT EXHAUSTION to HEAT STROKE</B> occurs when there is an alteration in mental status or neurological function.</i><br>
<br><b class="sz10r">Heat Stroke:</b> Dry (but not necessarily), hot, possibly red skin; altered level of consciousness. A true medical emergency with high mortality rate. Needs immediate treatment. Neurologic dysfunction can range from bizarre behavior to hallucinations and coma. Mistaking heat stroke for intoxication can have devastating
consequences.
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Non-Exertional: Occurs most often during heat waves.
<li>Elderly and chronically ill are at highest risk.
<li>Exertional: In young, healthy individuals performing intense physical activity in a high heat environment.
</ul>
<br><b class="sz10r">Pediatric Considerations:</b> Infants and toddlers are extremely vulnerable when overdressed, left in parked cars or exposed to the sun. Children are slower to acclimate and rarely are aware of early symptoms of heat stress. Infants and children depend on responsible
parents and care takers to provide protection and appropriate
preventive measures.</P>
