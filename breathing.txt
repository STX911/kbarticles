NEVER instruct the patient to breathe into a paper bag.
Common Diseases / Conditions Associated With Breathing Problems:
Acute
-heart attack -trauma to the chest wall/ abdomen
-pneumonia -foreign body aspiration'
-pulmonary embolus -congestive heart failure / pulmonary edema
-pneumothorax -pleurisy
-asthma -acute hyperventilation syndrome
-anxiety reaction -noxious gas inhalation
Chronic
i -COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
J-emphysema -chronic bronchitis
Upper Airway Problems
-croup -allergic reaction
-epiglottitis -foreign object trauma
Many patients suffering from asthma, COPD and allergies have medications
they have been instructed to use by their doctor in this type of situation.
Pediatric considerations: Breathing problems are the most common
pediatric medical problem handled by the EMD. Airway obstruction occurs
more frequently in infants and young children.

V. USEFUL INFORMATION
The term "heart problems" may range from skipped beats through
benign congestive heart failure to angina and heart attack (Myocardial
rc i Infarction). Ask about symptoms which more accurately' indicate the

4. Altered mental status
Automatic Implanted Defibrillator (AID): Implanted under the skin
similar to a pacemaker. The unit detects specific life threatening
arrhythmia and automatically shocks the patient.
Pediatric considerations: Heart problems in this age group usually
involve congenital defects. Parents are frequently aware of this because
of problems the child has already faced. These conditions often cause
the child to go into heart failure with acute symptoms of difficulty
,f breathing, change in color and altered mental status.

CVA = Cerebrovascular accident = Stroke = Brain dysfunction resulting
from interrupted blood flow.
These patients most often present with slurred or incoherent speech,
altered mental status, paralysis, weakness or facial drooping.
Most common causes:
-Cerebral Thrombosis: Clot forms inside a brain artery. 75-80% of
strokes. Major cause is IIhardening of the arteries"
(Arteriosclerosis characterized by fat deposits in the arteries.)
-Cerebral Embolism: Less common than thrombosis, but with more
rapid onset. Clot or fatty deposits form elsewhere in the body and
travel to the brain. Frequently from the heart chambers in
patients with certain cardiac arrythmias.
-Hemorrhage: 15 -20% of strokes. Vessel in the brain bursts, .
flooding the surrounding tissue. Sudden onset and rapid
:t progression. 80% fatal.
-M (Transient Ischemic Attack or IImini-strokell) Momentary
interruption in blood flow. Can be a precursor to an actual stroke.
Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours.
Symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected and the extent of
bleeding and/ or clot and may range from simple slurred speech to partial
paralysis to coma and death.
Except in cases of uncontrolled High Blood Pressure or ruptured
aneurysm, headache is NOT often a presenting complaint.

V. USEFUL INFORMATION
Possible causes may be:
Cardiac Arrest
Diabetic Problems
Overdose, poisoning
Heart Attack (Myocardial infarction)
Intoxication
Arrythmia (Irregular heart beat)
Stroke (CVA)
Carbon monoxide
Head Injury
Valvular Heart disease
Respiratory insufficiency
Seizures
Refer to specific Tab if appropriate.
The most frequent, serious cause of fainting is cardiac arrythmia.
Simple fainting (syncope): Rapid onset, brief duration and
recovery within a few minutes. Patient is usually upright at onset
and feels lightheaded or "woozy" just prior to the event.
-May be caused by fear, anxiety, pain, and even urination or
defecation.
-May be accompanied by jerky movements and
incontinence, mimicking seizure.
