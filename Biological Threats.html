<P CLASS="sz10"><b>Anthrax</b> is a potentially lethal naturally occurring infectious bacteria that is transmittable to humans, and is caused by bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax spores can be inhaled, swallowed or react to the skin.
Inhalation is the most dangerous transmission.<br><a HREF="#return">[Return]</a><br>
<ul class="sz10">
<li><b>Cutaneous (skin):</b>Occurs if the spores are in contact with an area of the skin that is not intact, such as a cut or sore. It is marked by a boil-like leison that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center. This forms responds to antibodies if treatment is started soon after symptoms appear.<br><a HREF="#return">[Return]</a><br><br>
<li><b>Inhaled: </b>Occurs when the spores enter the alveoli in the lungs and infest the chest. They produce toxins that cause hemorraging and fluid buildup in the lungs. Symptoms develop as soon as two days and as late as eight weeks after exposure, and appear flu-like, such as fever, muscle aches, coughing and chest pain. This form usually ends in death after lung damage and possible brain infection.<br><a HREF="#return">[Return]</a><BR>
</ul>
<a name="smallp" class="link3"></a>
<P class="sz10"><b>Smallpox</b> spreads directly from person to person, primarily by droplet nuclei expelled from the oropharynx of the infected person or by aerosol. Contaminated clothing or bed linen could also spread the virus. Symptoms include high fever, malaise, and prostration with headache and backache. Severe abdominal pain and delirium are sometimes present.<br>

<a name="tularem" class="link3"></a>
<P class="sz10"><b>Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)</b> is one of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known. Naturally accuired human infection occurs through a variety of mechnaisms such as bites, handling infected animal tissues or fluids, direct contact or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil, and inhalation of infective aerosols. Tularemia can result in respiratory failure, shock and death.<br>

<P class="sz10"><b>Surface Agents - </b> Phosgene gas, Chorline gas, Hydrogen cyanide, and Mustard gas. (Occur through inhalation)<br>
<a HREF="#return">[Return]</a></p>
<a name="nerve" class="link3"></a>
<P class="sz10"><b>Nerve Agents - </b> Sarin, Soman, Tabun, and VX (Act by blocking the transmission of nerve messages throughout the body and can be inhaled or absorbed.<br>

<P CLASS="sz12b"><BR>Radiological Threats</p>
<a name="radio" class="link3"></a>
<P class="sz10" class="link3"><b>Radiological</b> materials include Plutonium, other actinides or artificially produced radioactive nuclides. Causes widespread contamination resulting in fatalities and serious casualties. Can be released in liquid or solid aerosol form or used to contaminate water supplies.<br>
