<P CLASS="sz14b"><B>Bleeding Control<br>Useful Information</B></P>
<P CLASS="sz10r"><i><b>Focus on controlling the bleeding and monitoring for signs of shock rather than trying to estimate the amount of blood
loss.</b></i></P>
<P CLASS="sz12b"><b>Types of Bleeding:</b>
<ul CLASS="sz10">
<li><b>Arterial</b> Spurting or pumping vs. <b>Venous</b> (oozing or steady flow).
<li><b>Internal</b> Inside the body cavity, possibly due to ruptured organ or blood vessel, blunt trauma or fracture. May not be obvious until signs of shock develop. May be externalized in some conditions by vomiting blood or "coffee grounds", rectal bleeding or black tarry stools or vaginal bleeding.<br>
</ul>
</P>
<P CLASS="sz12b"><b>Control of Bleeding:</b><BR>
<P CLASS="sz10"><b><i>Direct pressure is your primary means of control.</i></b> It will control bleeding in the majority of situations. The other measures are added to, and not used in place of direct pressure.
<ul CLASS="sz10">
<li>First - direct pressure
<li>Second - elevate the part if the injury permits (combined with direct pressure)
<li>Third - pressure points (combined with direct pressure and elevation)
<li>Fourth - tourniquet (extremely dangerous, even in skilled hands) is a last resort if all else fails in an amputated extremity.<br>
</ul>
</P>
<P CLASS="sz12b"><b>Pediatric considerations:</b>
<P CLASS="sz10">Because of the larger surface area of the head in relation to the rest of the body, scalp and facial wounds can cause major hemorrhage.<br>
