<P class="sz10">You can estimate the body surface area on an adult that has been burned by using multiples of 9.<br><br>

In an adult who has been burned, the percent of the body involved can be calculated as follows:
<ul class="sz10">
<li>Head = 9% 
<li>Chest and abdomen = 18% 
<li>Upper/mid/low back and buttocks = 18% 
<li>Each arm = 9% 
<li>Groin = 1% 
<li>Each leg = 18% 
</ul>
As an example, if both legs (18% x 2 = 36%), the groin (1%), and the chest and abdomen (18%) were burned, this would involve 55% of the body.<br>
<br>Use the Rule of Nines to estimate the approximate size of the burn as this form of information is useful to responders.</P>
